# Workshop Templater

> ***Heads up:*** Build it locally if you want:
> `docker build . -f tools/templater/build/docker/Dockerfile -t workshop-templater:0.0.0`


## üîß Tooling: Igor

To simplify templating workflows, we use [`igor`](https://github.com/la-cc/igor) ‚Äî a lightweight shell wrapper to run your Docker-based tooling with ease.

### Install Igor:

```bash
sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/la-cc/igor/main/igor.sh -o /usr/local/bin/igor
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/igor
```

## Architecture? Just a Quick Look

![workshop-0](zimages/workshop-1.png)

Yeah, that‚Äôs how things are wired.

---

## 1. Use Case: vCluster ‚Äì The Fast Lane to K8s

![workshop-0](zimages/workshop-2.png)

Dev team just needs a place to deploy stuff. No frills, no drama.
They want a Kubernetes playground. Here‚Äôs how little it takes:

```yaml
clusters:
  - project: project-x
    groupRbac: "la-demos:g-gitops"
    argocd: "disabled"
    nodePools:
      - isolated: false
```

That‚Äôs it. Now spin it up:

```bash
igor ....
config-template --all
```

Need to jump into the cluster?

```bash
vcluster connect vcluster-project-x -n vcluster-project-x --server=vcluster-project-x.platformcon.stackit.run --print --kube-config-context-name vcluster-project-x > vcluster-project-x.yaml

kubectl --kubeconfig vcluster-project-x.yaml get ns
```

You're in. Done.

---

## 2. Use Case: vCluster + GitOps = üöÄ

![workshop-0](zimages/workshop-3.png)

Now the devs want GitOps.
Why? Because they‚Äôre tired of clicking and guessing.

Update the config:

```yaml
clusters:
  - project: project-x
    groupRbac: "la-demos:g-gitops"
    argocd: "enabled"
    nodePools:
      - isolated: false
```

Use `k9s`, cruise around:

```bash
k9s --kubeconfig vcluster-project-x.yaml
```

Wanna go full SSO? Sure. But **don‚Äôt** leave the Argo admin account wide open.
Either:

* Disable admin
* Add limited users
* Or better: Dex + your OIDC provider

SSO the right way. No shortcuts.

---

## 3. Use Case: vCluster + GitOps + Own Turf (Isolated Nodepool)

![workshop-0](zimages/workshop-4.png)

Shared node pool too noisy? Performance sucks when everyone‚Äôs on the same boat?

Cool. Get your own node pool:

```yaml
clusters:
  - project: project-x
    groupRbac: "la-demos:g-gitops"
    argocd: "enabled"
    nodePools:
      - isolated: true
```

Provision it:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply --auto-approve
```

Double-check:

```bash
kubectl get nodepool
```

Now check your app setup and `values.yaml`.
Push. Argo takes over. That's the GitOps promise.

---

## 4. Use Case: vCluster + Own Nodepool ‚Äì No GitOps

![workshop-0](zimages/workshop-6.png)

Second team joins. They want their own node pool, but no GitOps.

Still easy:

```yaml
clusters:
  - project: project-y
    groupRbac: "la-demos:g-gitops-2"
    argocd: "disabled"
    nodePools:
      - isolated: true
```

Create the node pool:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply --auto-approve
```

Deploy. Test. All yours:

```bash
vcluster connect vcluster-project-y -n vcluster-project-y --server=vcluster-project-y.platformcon.stackit.run --print --kube-config-context-name vcluster-project-y > vcluster-project-y.yaml

kubectl --kubeconfig vcluster-project-y.yaml get ns
```

---

## Cleanup? Just Delete It

We like onboarding. But offboarding?
Nobody wants to clean up ‚Äî unless it‚Äôs this easy.

Remove the config:

```yaml
clusters:
  - project: project-x
    groupRbac: "la-demos:g-gitops"
    argocd: "enabled"
    nodePools:
      - isolated: true
```

Then run Terraform:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply --auto-approve
```

Commit, push ‚Äî Argo wipes the slate clean.

## Want to Go Bigger?

![workshop-0](zimages/workshop-8.png)

* vSphere + Tanzu + LDAP
* Dex + OIDC + `kubelogin`
* Argo CD with Dex setup
* Automate it all: pipeline, pull requests, events ‚Äî your call

---

## Zoomed-Out View: The Big Picture

![workshop-0](zimages/workshop-7.png)

Everything sits on top:
Your cockpit, your sunrise, your vClusters, your other clusters.
Same model. Zero extra effort.

## What You‚Äôll Learn (or Already Did)

* How to build a real internal platform catalog
* What ‚Äúself-service‚Äù means (hint: not a pretty UI)
* GitOps: love it or hate it, it's powerful
* Developer pain is real ‚Äî make it go away
* App of Apps pattern, explained by doing
* ApplicationSets + cluster generators + label-based deploys
* Templating that actually scales
* Secrets management with External Secrets Operator = modern ops
* vCluster = ephemeral clusters in minutes
* Multi-tenancy done right
* Save serious \$\$\$ by doing this smart

**BE A REAL PLATFORM ENGINEER.**
Not a ticket-pusher. Not a YAML monkey.
Build tools, not toil.
